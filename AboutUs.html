  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Coffee Shop was founded in 2023 by our coffee enthusiasts, Lujain Darwazeh and Aya Khammash. Inspired by
    the love for coffee culture, we set out to create a coffee shop that would be a haven for coffee
    connoisseurs. Since then, Coffee Shop has grown into a beloved local establishment, known for its cozy
    ambiance, friendly staff, and unforgettable coffee creations.

  <h2>Our Team</h2>

    Behind every cup of coffee, there is a dedicated team of skilled baristas who share a passion for coffee
    and a commitment to excellence. Our team undergoes rigorous training to ensure that each cup is brewed to
    perfection, and they are always ready to share their expertise and recommendations with our valued customers.
